## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
* Spotify: The thing I like about it is the feature to get recommened or browse through a huge collection of songs as well as instruments and to see shorts of people singing as well.
* Shazam: It's simple I like that it can find me any song just by listening to it.
* Linkedn: To be able to connect with many people of similar ideas and well to find jobs and all.
* Manga Reader: It let's me to download manga and store them with an additional huge library of sources and mangas.

* One app that I have in mind is to build a platoform that let's the users to share tehir ideas and to put it simply a brainstorming app but also like threads or X but purely for developers and entrepreneurs.
 
## Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Learning the swift language but Xcode was the tough challenge to learn the editor and work on it. To get to know the features as well.
